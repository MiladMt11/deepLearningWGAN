# Comparative Study of ‘GAN’, ‘WGAN’ & ‘SN-WGAN’ Generative Networks 

## Objective:
This study is a comparative study between Generative
Adversarial Networks(GANs), WGANs, and WGANs with
spectral normalization. The three models were trained on
MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, and their
performance was evaluated using the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score. The results show that WGAN performs
better than DCGAN and SN-WGAN on the CIFAR and
MNIST datasets and SN-WGAN deliver better results on
the FashionMNIST dataset.
