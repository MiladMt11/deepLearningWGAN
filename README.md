# Comparative Study of ‘GAN’, ‘WGAN’ & ‘SN-WGAN’ Generative Networks 

## Objective:
This study is a comparative study between [Generative
Adversarial Networks(GANs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network), [WGANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_GAN), and WGANs with
spectral normalization [(SN-WGAN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875). The three models were trained on
[MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), [FashionMNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), and [CIFAR-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFAR-10) datasets, and their
performance was evaluated using the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score. The results show that WGAN performs
better than [DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434v2) and SN-WGAN on the CIFAR and
MNIST datasets and SN-WGAN deliver better results on
the FashionMNIST dataset.
